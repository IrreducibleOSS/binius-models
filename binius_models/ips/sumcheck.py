def compute_switchover(v: int, d: int, ratio: int) -> int:
    # returns: at which point should we switch from b √ó e muls, plus tensor expansion, to classical-style folding?
    # parameter `ratio`: what is the cost of an e √ó e mult, relative to that of a b √ó e?

    # in the simplest case len(multilinears) == 1 and subfield size 1 bit (and ignoring XORs), the best is at v/2.
    # more generally, allowing len(multilinears) == d you can calculate that the breakeven point happens at exactly
    # (log(d) + v) / 2. why? for each round, the cost of self.receive_challenge is:
    # - if round < switchover: exactly 2 ≥·µí·µò‚Åø·µà e √ó e mults.
    # - if round ‚â•¬†switchover, exactly d ‚ãÖ 2·µõ‚Åª ≥·µí·µò‚Åø·µà e √ó e mults.
    # thus we're interested in the smallest r for which d ‚ãÖ 2·µõ‚Åª ≥ ‚â§ 2 ≥ first becomes true.
    # taking logs of both sides, we see the inequality log(d) + v ‚â§¬†2 ‚ãÖ r, and we're done.

    # it becomes more complicated if we want to count the cost of b √ó e mults---
    # as we might, say, as soon as the field size of the polys is > 1 bit, or if we care about the cost of XORs.
    # of course the higher the cost of b √ó es, the earlier we will want the switchover to actually happen.
    # indeed, now counting b √ó es, the total cost of each round is 2·µõ‚Åª ≥·µí·µò‚Åø·µà‚Åª¬π ‚ãÖ deg polynomial evaluations,
    # where write `deg` for the total degree of the composition polynomial (it equals d when it's just a product),
    # (this cost is there regardless of pre-switchover or not), PLUS, in addition:
    # - if round < switchover: d ‚ãÖ 2·µõ b √ó e (compute folds on the fly) + 2 ≥·µí·µò‚Åø·µà e √ó e (tensor expand)
    # - if round > switchover: d ‚ãÖ 2·µõ‚Åª ≥·µí·µò‚Åø·µà e √ó e (classical folding)
    # - if round == switchover: d ‚ãÖ 2·µõ b √ó e + d ‚ãÖ 2·µõ‚Åª ≥·µí·µò‚Åø·µà e √ó e (on-the-fly and fold).
    # when you work it out, for arbitrary switchover r ‚àà {0, ..., v - 1}, the total cost across all rounds becomes:
    # f(r) :=
    # (2 ≥ ‚àí 1) e √ó e (total work of tensor expansion, up to but excluding the switchover round)
    # + d ‚ãÖ r ‚ãÖ 2·µõ b √ó e (total work of only-the-fly folds, including switchover round, but excluding 0th round)
    # + d ‚ãÖ (2·µõ‚Åª ≥‚Å∫¬π - 2) e √ó e (total work of classical folds, including the switchover round and following rounds)
    # so our goal is to choose r ‚àà {0, ..., v - 1} so as to minimze f(r), which is a straightforward calculation.
    # though the minimal value in practice will depend on the relative cost of b √ó es versus e √ó es, as well as d.
    # you can see that we have an amount of b √ó es which increases linearly in r (penalty for delaying the switch),
    # as well as the familiar exponentially increasing and decreasing costs in e √ó es of tensor and folding, resp.
